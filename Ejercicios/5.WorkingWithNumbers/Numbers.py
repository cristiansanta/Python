myNumber = -2
print(2.45 + 4 * 5)#Multiplication first operation
print(3*(5+6))#Parentesis first operation
print(10 % 3)#modulates operator
print(10 / 3)
print(myNumber)
print(str(myNumber) + " My Favorite Number")#Convert this number into a string
print(abs(myNumber))#absolute value So we can get the absolute value
print(pow(2, 3))#2^3
print(max(2, 7))#the larger of the two numbers, This function tell us which number is higher
print(min(2, 6))#the smallest number of the two numbers, This function tell us which number is smallest
print(round(5.45))#Redondear n√∫mero
print(floor(4.8))#It'll basically just grab the lowest number
print(ceil(3.1))#It'll basically just round the number up
print(sqrt(4))#Square Root basically
